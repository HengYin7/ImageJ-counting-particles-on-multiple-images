# ImageJ-counting-particles-on-multiple-images
This ImageJ code can be used to precisely count particles dots on mutiple images, respectively. Even the particles are conjugated,
individual particles can still be recognized and counted.
*HOW TO USE:
1. Install this code in macro, set up shortcut if you want;
2. Run the "particle counting all images-III" code, choose a file which contains all the images (the original format is 'bmp' becasue the    image files from microscope is 'bmp', user could always adjust the format for perosnal use).
3. Once ready, read the number of paticles from results window;
4. Run "close" code to automatically close all the image windows.
